class RReessppoonnssee(builtins.object)
 |  The :class:`Response <Response>` object, which contains a
 |  server's response to an HTTP request.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  ____bbooooll____(self)
 |      Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400.
 |      
 |      This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between
 |      400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error. If
 |      the status code, is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
 |      is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
 |  
 |  ____eenntteerr____(self)
 |  
 |  ____eexxiitt____(self, *args)
 |  
 |  ____ggeettssttaattee____(self)
 |  
 |  ____iinniitt____(self)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  ____iitteerr____(self)
 |      Allows you to use a response as an iterator.
 |  
 |  ____nnoonnzzeerroo____(self)
 |      Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400.
 |      
 |      This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between
 |      400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error. If
 |      the status code, is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
 |      is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
 |  
 |  ____rreepprr____(self)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  ____sseettssttaattee____(self, state)
 |  
 |  cclloossee(self)
 |      Releases the connection back to the pool. Once this method has been
 |      called the underlying ``raw`` object must not be accessed again.
 |      
 |      *Note: Should not normally need to be called explicitly.*
 |  
 |  iitteerr__ccoonntteenntt(self, chunk_size=1, decode_unicode=False)
 |      Iterates over the response data.  When stream=True is set on the
 |      request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for
 |      large responses.  The chunk size is the number of bytes it should
 |      read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
 |      returned as decoding can take place.
 |      
 |      chunk_size must be of type int or None. A value of None will
 |      function differently depending on the value of `stream`.
 |      stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
 |      chunks are received. If stream=False, data is returned as
 |      a single chunk.
 |      
 |      If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best
 |      available encoding based on the response.
 |  
 |  iitteerr__lliinneess(self, chunk_size=512, decode_unicode=False, delimiter=None)
 |      Iterates over the response data, one line at a time.  When
 |      stream=True is set on the request, this avoids reading the
 |      content at once into memory for large responses.
 |      
 |      .. note:: This method is not reentrant safe.
 |  
 |  jjssoonn(self, **kwargs)
 |      Returns the json-encoded content of a response, if any.
 |      
 |      :param \*\*kwargs: Optional arguments that ``json.loads`` takes.
 |      :raises ValueError: If the response body does not contain valid json.
 |  
 |  rraaiissee__ffoorr__ssttaattuuss(self)
 |      Raises :class:`HTTPError`, if one occurred.

 |  Readonly properties defined here:
 |  
 |  aappppaarreenntt__eennccooddiinngg
 |      The apparent encoding, provided by the chardet library.
 |  
 |  ccoonntteenntt
 |      Content of the response, in bytes.
 |  
 |  iiss__ppeerrmmaanneenntt__rreeddiirreecctt
 |      True if this Response one of the permanent versions of redirect.
 |  
 |  iiss__rreeddiirreecctt
 |      True if this Response is a well-formed HTTP redirect that could have
 |      been processed automatically (by :meth:`Session.resolve_redirects`).
 |  
 |  lliinnkkss
 |      Returns the parsed header links of the response, if any.
 |  
 |  nneexxtt
 |      Returns a PreparedRequest for the next request in a redirect chain, if there is one.
 |  
 |  ookk
 |      Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400, False if not.
 |      
 |      This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between
 |      400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error. If
 |      the status code is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
 |      is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
 |  
 |  tteexxtt
 |      Content of the response, in unicode.
 |      
 |      If Response.encoding is None, encoding will be guessed using
 |      ``chardet``.
 |      
 |      The encoding of the response content is determined based solely on HTTP
 |      headers, following RFC 2616 to the letter. If you can take advantage of
 |      non-HTTP knowledge to make a better guess at the encoding, you should
 |      set ``r.encoding`` appropriately before accessing this property.
